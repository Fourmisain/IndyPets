## IndyPets - Independent Pets

This is the official continuation of lizin5ths's [Independent Pets v0.4.1 on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/indypets).  
(The original source code can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/Q7WX2tUX), and it was specified to be CC0 [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/indypets?comment=98).)

### Description

Free your pets from the curse of having to sit down, let 'em roam!

Independent pets won't follow or teleport to you but roam around, doing their own thing!  
Right Click to cycle between sitting, following, and independent.   
Shift + Right Click to toggle following and independent directly.    
Whistle/Unwhistle (J) to toggle all your nearby pets - rally your army!  

Pets have a home where they won't stray too far off. "Home" is where they were last set independent. 

The mod can work completely server-only.  
Vanilla clients can use `/indypets whistle` and `unwhistle` commands and  
`/indypets config` `get` to view and `set` change some basic settings and `help` get descriptions.  
It is recommended to install the mod client-side too for whistle and interact hotkeys, whistle sound effects, translated status messages and more config options.

In case (Shift +) Right Click conflicts with other mods or modded pets, try IndyPets' Interact hotkey (H) or one of the many compatibility options in the config.

- for Minecraft 1.16 and above
- requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and Fabric API
